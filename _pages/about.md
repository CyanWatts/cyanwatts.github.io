My name is Xian Fu. Now I’m a 3rd year MS student of the College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, supervised by Prof. [Jianye Hao](http://www.icdai.org/jianye.html). Before that, I got my Bachelor Degree from Jilin University, Tang Aoqing Honors Program (Computer Science) at 2022.

My research interests lie in Reinforcement Learning, Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning, Representation Learning, MLLMs/LLMs for Robotics, and so on. In addition to these areas, I am interested in interdisciplinary projects in robotics, automation, and other AI-driven fields.

I am currently seeking a PhD opportunity for Spring 2026 to further my research in these areas. If my background aligns with your interests, or if you'd like to discuss potential collaboration, please feel free to contact me at [fuxian1224@gmail.com](fuxian1224@gmail.com).
